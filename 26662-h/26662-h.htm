<h2>ACT I</h2>


<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>ploughing. Looks up</i>] It's noon. Time to unharness.
Gee up, get along! Fagged out? Poor old
beast! One more turn and back again, that will be the
last furrow, and then dinner. It was a good idea to bring
that chunk of bread with me. I'll not go home, but sit
down by the well and have a bite and a rest, and Peggy
can graze awhile. Then, with God's help, to work again,
and the ploughing will be done in good time.</p>

<p><i>Enter Imp; hides behind a bush.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">IMP.</span> See what a good fellow he is! Keeps calling on
God. Wait a bit, friend,&mdash;you'll be calling on the Devil
before long! I'll just take away his chunk. He'll miss
it before long, and will begin to hunt for it. He'll be
hungry, and then he'll swear and call on the Devil.</p>

<p><i>Takes the chunk of bread and sits down behind the bush
watching to see what the Peasant will do.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>unharnesses the horse</i>] With God's blessing!
[<i>Lets the horse loose, and goes towards the place where his
coat is lying</i>] I'm awfully hungry. The wife cut a big
chunk, but see if I don't eat it all. [<i>Coming up to the coat</i>]
Gone! I must have put it under the coat. [<i>Lifting the
coat</i>] No, it's not here either! What has happened?
[<i>Shakes the coat</i>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100">100</a></span>
<span class="speaker">IMP</span> [<i>behind the bush</i>] Go on, go on, search away! I've
got it safe!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>moves the plough and shakes his coat again</i>] This
is strange! Very strange! No one was here, yet the chunk
is gone! If the birds had been at it there would be
some crumbs left, but there's not a single crumb! No
one has been here, and yet some one has taken it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IMP</span> [<i>rises and looks out</i>] Now he'll call on the Devil.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Well, it seems there's no help for it! Never
mind, I shan't starve to death. If some one has taken it,
he's taken it; let him eat it, and may it do him good.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IMP</span> [<i>spits</i>] Oh, the damned peasant! Instead of swearing
properly, he only says, &ldquo;May it do him good.&rdquo; What
can one do with such a fellow?</p>

<p><i>Peasant lies down to rest, makes the sign of the cross, yawns,
and falls asleep.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">IMP</span> [<i>comes out from behind the bush</i>] It's all very well
for the boss to talk. The boss keeps on saying, &ldquo;You
don't bring enough peasants to Hell! See what a lot of
tradesmen, gentlefolk, and all sorts of people flock in
every day, and how few peasants!&rdquo; Now, how's one
to get round this one? There's no way of getting hold
of him. Haven't I stolen his last crust? What can I do
better than that? And yet he didn't swear. I'm at my
wits' end what to do! Well, I must go and report!</p>

<p><i>Disappears into the ground.</i></p>

<h2>ACT II</h2>

<p class="scene">Hell. The Chief of the Devils sits in the highest place. The
Devil's Secretary sits lower down, at a table with writing
materials. Sentinels stand at each side. To the right are
five Imps of different kinds. To the left, by the door, the
Doorkeeper. A dandified Imp stands before the Chief.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">THE DANDY IMP.</span> The whole of my booty for the three
years has been 220,005 men. They're all in my power
now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE CHIEF.</span> All right. Thank you. Pass on.</p>

<p><i>The Dandy Imp goes to the right.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE CHIEF</span> [<i>to the Secretary</i>] I'm tired! Is there much
business left? Whose reports have we had, and whose
are still to come?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE SECRETARY</span> [<i>counts on his fingers and, as he counts,
points to the Imps to the right. When he mentions any Imp,
the one referred to bows</i>] We've had the Gentlefolks' Devil's
report. He's captured 1836 in all. And the Tradesmen's
Devil's with 9643. From the Lawyers', 3423. The Women's
we've also just had: 186,315 married women, and 17,438
maids. Only two Devils are left, the Officials' and the
Peasants'. There are altogether 220,005 souls on the
list.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Well then, we'd better finish it all to-day. [<i>To
the Doorkeeper</i>] Let them in!</p>

<p><i>The Officials' Devil enters, and bows to the Chief.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Well, how have you got on?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">OFFICIALS' IMP</span> [<i>laughing, and rubbing his hands</i>] My affairs
are all right, just as soot they are white! The booty is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102">102</a></span>such that I don't remember anything like it since the
creation of the world.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> What, have you captured a great many?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">OFFICIALS' IMP.</span> It's not so much the quantity. Only
1350 men in all, but such splendid fellows! Such fellows,
they might shame any Devil! They can embroil people
better than we ourselves can. I've introduced a new
fashion among them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> What's that new fashion?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">OFFICIALS' IMP.</span> Why, in former times lawyers were in
attendance on the judges and deceived people. Now, I've
arranged for them to do business also apart from the judges.
Whoever pays most, is the one to whose business they
attend. And they'll take such trouble over it that they'll
make out a case where there is none! They and the
officials between them embroil people far better than we
Devils can.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> All right. I'll have a look at them. You may
pass on.</p>

<p><i>The Officials' Imp goes to the right.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF</span> [<i>to Doorkeeper</i>] Let in the last one.</p>

<p><i>Enter the Peasants' Imp with the chunk of bread. He bows
to the ground.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> I can't live like this any longer! Give
me another appointment!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> What appointment? What are you jabbering
about? Get up and talk sense. Give in your report!
How many peasants have you captured this week?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP</span> [<i>crying</i>] Not one!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> What? Not one! What do you mean? What
have you been doing? Where have you been loafing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP</span> [<i>whimpering</i>] I've not been loafing; I've
been straining every nerve all the time, but I can't do
anything! There now, I went and took his last crust
from under the very nose of one of them, and, instead of
swearing, he wished it might do me good!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103">103</a></span>
<span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> What?&hellip; What?&hellip; What are you mumbling
there? Just blow your nose, and then speak sensibly!
One can't make head or tail of what you're saying.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> Why, there was a peasant ploughing;
and I knew he had brought only a chunk of bread with
him, and had nothing else to eat. I stole his crust. By
rights he should have sworn; but what does he do? He
says, &ldquo;Let him who has taken it eat it, and may it do him
good!&rdquo; I've brought the chunk of bread away with me.
Here it is!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Well, and what of the others?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> They're all alike. I could not manage
to take a single one.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> How dare you appear before me with empty
hands? And as if that were not enough, you must needs
bring some stinking crust or other here! Do you mean to
mock me? Do you mean to live in Hell and eat the bread
of idleness? The others do their best, and work hard!
Why, they [<i>points to the Imps</i>] have each supplied 10,000
or 20,000, or even 200,000. And you come with empty
hands, and bring a miserable crust, and begin spinning
your yarns. You chatter, but don't work; and that's why
you've lost hold of them. But wait a bit, my friend, I'll
teach you a thing or two!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> Before you punish me, listen to what I'll
tell you. It's all very well for those other Devils, who
have to do with gentlefolk, with merchants, or with
women. It's all plain sailing for them! Show a nobleman
a coronet, or a fine estate, and you've got him, and may
lead him where you like. It's the same with a tradesman.
Show him some money and stir up his covetousness, and
you may lead him as with a halter. And with the women
it's also plain sailing. Give them finery and sweets&mdash;and
you may do what you like with them. But as to the
peasants&mdash;there's a long row to hoe with them! When
he's at work from morn till night&mdash;sometimes even far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104">104</a></span>into the night&mdash;and never starts without a thought of God,
how's one to get at him? Master, remove me from these
peasants! I'm tired to death of them, and have angered
you into the bargain!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> You're humbugging, you idler! It's no use
your talking about the others. They've got hold of the
merchants, the nobles, and the women, because they knew
how to treat them, and invented new traps for them! The
official one there&mdash;he has made quite a new departure.
You must think of something too! You've stolen a crust,
and brag about it! What a clever thing to do! Surround
them with snares, and they'll get caught in one or other
of them. But loafing about as you do, and leaving the
way open for them, those peasants of yours have gained
strength. They begin not to care about their last crust.
If they take to such ways, and teach their women the
same, they'll get quite beyond us! Invent something!
Get out of the hole as best you can.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> I can't think how to set about it. Let
me off! I can stand it no longer!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF</span> [<i>angrily</i>] Can't stand it! What do you think,
then? Am I to do your work for you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> I can't!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Can't? Wait a bit! Hollo, there! bring the
switches; give him a thrashing.</p>

<p><i>The Sentinels seize the Imp and whip him.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> Oh! Oh! Oh!&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Have you thought of something?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> Oh, oh, I can't!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Give him some more. [<i>They whip</i>] Well&mdash;thought
of something?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> Yes&mdash;yes, I have!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Well, tell us what it is.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> I've invented a dodge that will bring
them all into my grasp, if you'll only let me take a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105">105</a></span>labourer's place with that peasant. But I can't explain
what it is beforehand.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> All right. Only remember, that if you don't
atone for that crust within three years, I'll flay you alive!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> They'll all be mine in three years' time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> All right. When the three years are past, I
shall come and see for myself!</p>

<h2>ACT III</h2>

<p class="scene">A barn. Carts loaded with grain. The Imp as a Labourer.
He is shovelling grain off the cart, and the Peasant is carrying
it away in a measure.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Seven!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> How many quarters?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER</span> [<i>looks at the numbers marked on the barn door</i>]
Twenty-six quarters. And this is the seventh bushel of
the twenty-seventh quarter.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> It won't all go in; the barn is nearly full!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Shovel it nice and even.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> So I will.</p>

<p><i>Exit with measure.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER</span> [<i>alone, takes off his cap, his horns appear</i>] It will
be some time before he returns. I'll ease my horns a bit.
[<i>Horns rise</i>] And I'll take my boots off too; I can't do it
when he's here. [<i>Takes his boots off, his hoofs appear. Sits
on the threshold</i>] It's the third year now. It's near the
time of reckoning. There's more corn than there's room
for. Only one more thing left to teach him, and then let
the Chief come and see for himself. I'll have something
worth showing him! He'll forgive me for that crust!</p>

<p><i>Neighbour approaches. Labourer hides his horns and hoofs.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Good day to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> The same to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Where's your master?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> He's gone to spread the grain more even; it
won't all go in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Dear me, what a run of luck your master is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107">107</a></span>having! More than he has room for? We're all amazed
at the harvests your master has had these two years. It's
as if some one had told him what was coming. Last year
was a dry season, and he had sown in the bog. Others had
no harvest, but your threshing ground was covered with
sheaves! This year we've a rainy summer, and he's been
sharp enough to sow on the hill. Everybody's corn has
rotted, but you have a splendid harvest. What grain!
Ah, what grain!</p>

<p><i>Takes some grain, weighs it in his hand, and chews it.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>enters with empty measure</i>] How d'ye do, neighbour?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Good day. I was saying to your man here,
how well you managed to guess where to sow your corn.
Every one envies you. What heaps, what heaps of corn
you have got! You'll not eat it all in ten years.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> It's all thanks to Nicholas here. [<i>Points to
Labourer</i>] It was his luck. Last year I sent him to plough,
and what did he do but plough in the bog. I gave him a
scolding, but he persuaded me to sow there. And so I
did, and it turned out all for the best! And this year he
again guessed right, and sowed on the hill!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> It's as if he knew what kind of season it
would be. Yes, you have got corn enough and no mistake!
[<i>Silence</i>] And I have come to ask you to lend me a sack
of rye. Ours is all used up. I'll return it next year.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> All right, you may have it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER</span> [<i>nudging the Peasant</i>] Don't give it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> No more words about it. Take it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Thank you. I'll just run and fetch a sack.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER</span> [<i>aside</i>] He keeps to his old ways &hellip; still
goes on giving. He doesn't always obey me. But just
wait a bit. He'll soon stop giving away.</p>

<p><i>Exit Neighbour.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>sitting down on the threshold</i>] Why should one
not give to a good man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108">108</a></span>
<span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Giving is one thing, getting back another!
You know&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 29em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;It's a good world to lend in, a good world to spend in,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But to get back one's own, it's the worst world that's known.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That's what the old folk say.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Don't worry. We've plenty of corn.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Well, what of that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> We've enough, not only till next harvest but
for two years ahead. What are we to do with it all?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> What are we to do with it? I could make
such stuff of this corn as would make you rejoice all the
days of your life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Why, what would you make of it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> A kind of drink. Drink, that would give
you strength when you are weak, satisfy you when you
are hungry, give you sleep when you are restless, make
you merry when you're sad, give you courage when you're
afraid. That's the drink I'd make!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Rubbish!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Rubbish indeed! It was just the same when
I told you to sow in the bog, and then on the hill. You
did not believe me then, but now you know! You'll
find out about the drink the same way.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> But what will you make it of?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Why, of this same corn.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> But won't that be a sin?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Just hear him! Why should it be a sin?
Everything is given for a joy to man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> And where did you get all your wisdom from,
Nick? You seem a very ordinary man to look at, and
hard-working too. Why, I don't remember you so much
as ever taking your boots off all these two years you've been
with me. And yet you seem to know everything. Where
did you learn it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> I've been about a good deal!</p>

<span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> And so you say this drink will give one
strength?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Just wait till you try it and see the good
that comes of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> And how are we to make it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> It's not hard to make when you know how!
Only we shall want a copper and a couple of iron vessels.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> And does it taste nice?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> As sweet as honey. When once you've tasted
it you'll never give it up.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Is that so? Well, I'll go to the neighbour's;
he used to have a copper. We'll have a try!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>sitting on his heels and looking on</i>] What a queer

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> It's not water. It is the very stuff itself!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Why is it so clear? I thought it would be

Wait a bit, when you and I drink it every day we'll grow

<h2>ACT V</h2>

<p class="scene">Interior of hut. The Labourer alone, his horns and hoofs
showing.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> There's lots of corn. More than there's
room for, and he's now got a taste for it. We've been
distilling again, and we've filled a barrel and hidden it
away. We're not going to treat any one for nothing, but
when we want to get something out of a fellow, then we'll
treat him! So to-day I told him to invite the village
elders and treat them, that they should divide up the
property between him and his grandfather, and give
everything to him and nothing to the old man! My three
years are up to-day, and my work is finished. Let the
Chief come and see for himself. I needn't be ashamed of
his seeing it!</p>

<p><i>Chief appears out of the ground.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Time's up! Have you redeemed your bread-blunder?
I told you I'd come and see for myself. Have
you managed the Peasant?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Done him completely! Judge for yourself.
Some of them will meet here soon. Get into the oven,
and see what they'll do. You'll be well satisfied!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF</span> [<i>climbs into the oven</i>] We'll see!</p>

<p><i>Enter the Peasant and four old men. The Wife follows.
The men sit down round the table. The Wife lays the cloth,
sets ox-foot brawn and pies on the table. The old men exchange
greetings with Labourer.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST ELDER.</span> Well, have you made more of the drink?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115">115</a></span>
<span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Yes, we've distilled as much as we need.
Why let valuable stuff be wasted?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND ELDER.</span> And is it a success?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Better than the first lot.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND ELDER.</span> But where did you learn to make it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Going about in the world one learns many
things!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD ELDER.</span> Yes, yes, you're a knowing fellow.</p>

<p><i>Wife brings spirits and glasses.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Have a drop!</p>

<p><i>Wife takes a decanter and fills glasses.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">WIFE.</span> Do us the honour!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST ELDER</span> [<i>drinks</i>] Your health! Ah, that's good. It
runs right through all one's joints. That's what I call
proper drink!</p>

<p><i>The other three Elders do the same. Chief gets out of the
oven. Labourer goes and stands by him.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER</span> [<i>to Chief</i>] See what will happen now! I'll
trip up the woman with my foot and she'll spill the
liquor. Formerly he did not grudge his last crust, but
now see what he'll do about a glass of spirits!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Now then, wife, fill again and hand it round
in due order&mdash;first to our friend here, then to Daddy
Michael.</p>

<p><i>Wife fills a glass and goes round the table. The Labourer
trips her up; she stumbles and upsets the glass.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">WIFE.</span> Gracious goodness, I've spilt it! Why do you
get in my way, confound you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>to Wife</i>] There now, what a clumsy beast! Her
fingers are all thumbs, and she goes swearing at others!
See what fine stuff she goes spilling on the ground!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">WIFE.</span> I didn't do it on purpose.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> On purpose indeed! Wait till I get up; I'll
teach you how to pour spirits on the ground. [<i>To Labourer</i>]
And you too, you confounded fool, what are you prancing
round the table for? Go to the Devil!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER</span> [<i>goes back to the oven to the Chief</i>] You see?
Formerly he did not grudge his last crust, and now for a
glass of spirits he nearly beat his wife and sent me to you&mdash;to
the Devil!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> It's good, very good! I'm satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> You wait a bit. Let them empty the bottle&mdash;and
you'll see what will happen. Even now they are
giving each other smooth oily words; presently they'll
start flattering each other,&mdash;as cunning as foxes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Well, old friends, what's your opinion of my
business? My grandfather has been living with me, and
I have been feeding him and feeding him, and now he's
gone to live with my uncle, and wants to take his share
of the property and give it to uncle! Consider it well;
you are wise men. We could as well do without our own
heads as without you. There's no one in the whole village
to come near you. Take you for example, Iv&aacute;n Fed&oacute;titch&mdash;doesn't
every one say you're first among men? And
as for me, I'll tell you the truth, Iv&aacute;n Fed&oacute;titch, I'm
fonder of you than of my own father or mother. As for
Michael Step&aacute;nitch, he's an old friend.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST ELDER</span> [<i>to Peasant</i>] It's good to talk with a good
man. It's the way to get wisdom. It's just the same
with you. One can't find any one to compare with you
either.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND ELDER.</span> Wise and affectionate&mdash;that's what I like
you for.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD ELDER.</span> You have my best sympathy. I can't
find words to express it. I was saying to my old woman
only to-day&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FOURTH ELDER.</span> A friend, a real friend!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER</span> [<i>nudges the Chief</i>] Do you hear? All lies!
They abuse one another behind their backs, but see how
thick they are laying it on now,&mdash;like foxes wagging their
tails! And it all comes from that drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117">117</a></span>
<span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> That drink is good, very good! If they take to
lying like that, they'll all be ours. Very good; I'm
satisfied!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Wait a bit. When they've finished a second
bottle it will be better still!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">WIFE</span> [<i>serves</i>] Do have another glass.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST ELDER.</span> Won't it be too much? Your health!
[<i>Drinks</i>] It's pleasant to drink in the company of a good
man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND ELDER.</span> How can one help drinking? Health
to the host and hostess!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD ELDER.</span> Friends, your health!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FOURTH ELDER.</span> This is a brew of the right sort! Let's
be merry! We'll arrange things for you. 'Cos it all
depends on me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST ELDER.</span> On you? No, not on you, but on what
your seniors say.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FOURTH ELDER.</span> My seniors are greater fools. Go where
you came from!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND ELDER.</span> What are you up to now? You fool!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD ELDER.</span> It's true what he's saying! 'Cos why?
The host is not entertaining us for nothing. He means
business. The business can be arranged. Only you must
stand treat! Show us due respect. 'Cos it's you as wants
me, and not I you! You're own brother to the pig!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> And you're itself! What are you yelling for?
Think to surprise me? You are all good at stuffing
yourselves!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST ELDER.</span> What are you giving yourself airs for?
See if I don't twist your nose to one side!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> We'll see whose nose will get twisted!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND ELDER.</span> Think yourself such a marvel? Go to
the Devil! I won't speak to you&mdash;I'll go away!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>holds him</i>] What, will you break up the company?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>to the other Elders</i>] Help me!</p>

<p><i>They fall on one another, and all speak at once.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST ELDER.</span> That's why. 'Cos it means we're all having
a spree-ee!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND ELDER.</span> I can arrange everything!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD ELDER.</span> Let's have some more!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>to Wife</i>] Bring another bottle!</p>

<p><i>All sit round the table again and drink.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER</span> [<i>to Chief</i>] Have you noticed? The wolf's
blood in them was aroused, and they've turned as fierce as
wolves.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> The drink is good! I'm satisfied!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Wait a bit. Let them empty a third bottle.

drunken screams. An old man comes out and shouts in a tipsy
voice. The Peasant follows him and leads him back.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">GRANDFATHER.</span> Ah, what doings! what doings! One
would think, what more would any one want than to do
his work on week days, and when Sunday comes round,
to have a good wash, clean the harness, and rest a bit and

the old folk about matters concerning the Commune.
Or, if you're young, have a game. There they are playing,&mdash;and
it's pleasant to look at them. It's all pleasant and
good. [<i>Screams inside the hut</i>] But this sort of thing, what
